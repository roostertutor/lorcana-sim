## 1. CONCEPTS

### 1.1 General
| Rule | Quote | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1.1.1 | Two or more players | ⚠️ Only 2-player supported |
| 1.1.7 | Reminder text in italics isn't rules text | N/A |

### 1.2 Golden Rules
| Rule | Quote | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1.2.1 | Card text supersedes game rules | ⚠️ Architecture exists (`gameModifiers.ts`) but not all override mechanisms built yet |
| 1.2.2 | Preventing effects supersede allowing effects | ❌ Not implemented (e.g., Tiana vs Genie scenario) |
| 1.2.3 | Do as much as possible ("do as much as you can") | ✅ Engine behavior is correct: effects no-op when no valid targets, actions remain legal. Examples: Dragon Fire on empty board, Sudden Chill with one opposing character, The Queen's "each opponent" with one opponent. No formal tracking needed — silent no-op IS the correct behavior |

### 1.5 Costs
| Rule | Quote | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1.5.3 | Cost must be paid in full; can't play if unable | ✅ Validated in `validatePlayCard` / `validateActivateAbility` |
| 1.5.5 | Alternate costs (Shift, Singer, "for free") | ✅ Shift implemented; Singer ❌; "for free" ❌ |
| 1.5.5.1 | Singing a song is an alternate cost | ❌ |
| 1.5.5.2 | Shift is an alternate cost | ✅ |
| 1.5.5.3 | "For free" means ignore all costs | ❌ |

### 1.6 Abilities
| Rule | Quote | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1.6.1 | Abilities apply only when source is in play (with exceptions) | ✅ Trigger fizzle logic in `processTriggerStack` |
| 1.6.1.1 | Triggered abilities | ✅ |
| 1.6.1.2 | Activated abilities | ✅ |
| 1.6.1.3 | Static abilities | ⚠️ Architecture exists; `cant_be_challenged` handled; most others not yet |
| 1.6.1.4 | Replacement effects | ❌ Not implemented |
| 1.6.1.5 | Keywords | ✅ Most set 1 keywords implemented |

### 1.7 Game Actions, Timing, and Illegal Actions
| Rule | Quote | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1.7.2 | Effects must fully resolve before next can happen | ⚠️ Trigger stack enforces this for triggered abilities; simultaneous resolution not modeled |
| 1.7.5 | **Drying**: characters can't quest/challenge/exert unless in play since beginning of their player's turn | ✅ `isDrying` boolean; Rush bypasses for challenges only |
| 1.7.6 | Illegal action: undo all steps, payments reversed | ⚠️ We return `success: false` and don't mutate state, but don't log "undo". Open question: would undo help bot learning? See DECISIONS.md Open Questions |

### 1.8 Game State Check
| Rule | Quote | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1.8.1.1 | Player with 20+ lore wins | ✅ `checkWinConditions` / `getLoreThreshold` |
| 1.8.1.2 | Player who ends turn with empty deck loses | ✅ Checked in `applyPassTurn`; game ends immediately with opponent as winner |
| 1.8.1.4 | Character/location with damage >= willpower is banished | ✅ `banishCard` called from damage resolution |
| 1.8.2 | Triggered abilities from state check added to bag before resolving | 🐛 `condition` field exists on `TriggeredAbility` type but `processTriggerStack()` never evaluates it. CRD 6.2.4 says conditions must be checked at resolution time. See missing features table |

### 1.9 Damage
| Rule | Quote | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1.9.1 | Damage represented by counters; can be dealt/put/removed/moved/taken | ✅ `damage` field on `CardInstance` |
| 1.9.3 | When a character leaves play, all damage counters cease to exist | ✅ `moveCard` moves to discard, damage stays on instance but is irrelevant |

### 1.11 Lore
| Rule | Quote | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1.11.1 | Player starts at 0 lore; can't go below 0 | ✅ `gainLore` enforces (no negative lore) |
| 1.11.2 | Quest character gains lore equal to its {L}; no lore if {L} = 0 | ✅ `getEffectiveLore` |
| 1.11.3 | 20+ lore wins | ✅ |

### 1.12 Drawing
| Rule | Quote | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1.12.1 | Draw: top card of deck to hand | ✅ `applyDraw` |
| 1.12.2 | Cards drawn one at a time | ✅ Loop in `applyDraw` |
| 1.12.3 | "Put into hand" is not "drawing" | ⚠️ `return_to_hand` effect exists and is separate from `draw`. Missing: "put into hand from deck" without triggering draw abilities. Example: Mother Knows Best (return card from discard to hand ≠ draw) |

---

## 2. GAMEPLAY

### 2.2 Setup Stage
| Rule | Quote | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 2.2.1.3 | Each player begins with 0 lore | ✅ `createGame` initializer |
| 2.2.1.4 | Each player draws 7 cards (opening hand) | ✅ Tested: "deals 7 cards to each player" |
| 2.2.2 | Players may alter their opening hand (mulligan) | ❌ Not implemented. Very important — needs deeper design thinking for bot mulligan strategy |

### 2.3 In-Game Stage
| Rule | Quote | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 2.3.3.1 | Win at 20+ lore | ✅ |
| 2.3.3.2 | Lose when turn ends with empty deck | ✅ |
| 2.3.3.4 | Concede at any time | N/A Bots play to completion; concession has no analytical value |

---

|------|-------|--------|
| 3.4.1.1 | "At the end of the turn" / "at the end of your turn" triggered abilities added and resolved | ❌ `queueTriggersByEvent("turn_end")` exists but no cards use it yet. Future example: Maximus - Relentless Pursuer |

## SUMMARY: Bugs Fixed (Session 5)

| # | Bug | CRD Ref | Fix |
|---|-----|---------|-----|
| B1 | Rush allows questing; should only allow challenging | 8.9.1 | ✅ Validator checks Rush keyword; bypasses isDrying for challenges only |
| B2 | Shift sets `damage: 0`; should inherit damage from base | 8.10.6 | ✅ `damage: shiftTarget.damage` |
| B3 | Shift sets `hasActedThisTurn: true` unconditionally; should inherit dry/drying from base | 8.10.4 | ✅ `isDrying: shiftTarget.isDrying` |
| B4 | `applyPassTurn` readies only play zone; inkwell cards not readied | 3.2.1.1 | ✅ Added inkwell loop |
| B5 | `hasActedThisTurn` boolean conflates questing restriction with challenging restriction | 5.1.1.11 | ✅ Renamed to `isDrying`; drying is now a proper CRD concept |
| B6 | Resist applies to "put/moved" damage; should only reduce "dealt" damage | 8.8.3 | ✅ Added `ignoreResist` parameter to `dealDamageToCard` |

## SUMMARY: Missing Features (set 1 scope)

| Feature | CRD Ref | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Bodyguard enters play exerted | 8.3.2 | |
| Reckless can't quest + can't pass if able to challenge | 8.7.2–3 | `it.todo` |
| Support (quest to buff another character's {S}) | 8.13.1 | `it.todo` |
| Singer (exert to sing songs) | 8.11 | `it.todo` |
| ~~Starting player skips first draw~~ | 3.2.3.1 | ✅ Was already implicit in code structure |
| Actions card type | 5.4.1 | Not set 1 priority but needed for songs |
| Locations card type | 5.6 | Full section missing |
| Shift stack: all stack cards leave play together | 8.10.7 | |
| Replacement effects | 6.5 | Complex; needed for many later-set cards |
| Floating/delayed triggered abilities | 6.2.7 | Needed for action cards that create ongoing effects |
| "For free" play | 1.5.5.3 | Needed for Mufasa, Pride Lands, etc. |
| Mulligan | 2.2.2 | |
| Trigger condition evaluation | 1.8.2 / 6.2.4 | `processTriggerStack` never evaluates `TriggeredAbility.condition` at resolution time. Small fix in `reducer.ts` ~line 804 |
