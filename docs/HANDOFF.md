# Cross-Session Handoff Notes

Items flagged by one session for another to pick up.

Conventions:
- List only **open** items. Strike-through DONE entries while a task is fresh,
  then delete them once the rationale is captured in the commit message or no
  longer needed for context. Keep a DONE entry only when it preserves non-trivial
  reasoning not in a single commit (multi-commit decisions, deliberate non-fixes).

## Simulator: bot policy enumerator only generates single-pick for multi-pick choices

`packages/simulator/src/rl/policy.ts:232-242` — the `choose_from_revealed`
candidate enumerator emits one candidate per valid target (single pick) plus
an empty-array candidate if optional. For mandatory multi-pick effects
(e.g. Dig a Little Deeper: pick exactly 2), this underfills — the bot will
only put 1 card into hand instead of 2, leaving the other picks on deck.

Fix: for `choose_from_revealed` backed by `look_at_top` with
`pendingEffect.maxToHand > 1`, enumerate multi-pick combinations (or at least
pick the top-K valid targets as a single candidate when mandatory). May need
a similar pass in any other bot that handles this choice type.
